# Deep Learning and Traditional Approach for Modeling Seasonal Time Series 
Sales Prediction on time series data

There are many traditional and deep learning-based methods that have been proposed in the literature to improve the accuracy and precision of sales time series models. In my work it is then about to modelling and forecasting sales based on the popular traditional methods like Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA), and Long-Short-term Memory (LSTM) as deep learning method and compare each model to each other based on evaluation metrics like ME, MAE, RMSE ACF1, AIC and BIC.
